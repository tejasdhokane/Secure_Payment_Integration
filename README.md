DISCRIPTION: A payment gateway allows businesses to securely accept online payments. In .NET 8, MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller) and Entity Framework (EF) provide a 
            structured approach for managing data, user interfaces, and application logic. A secure payment integration in such an application involves connecting to a payment 
            processor (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, or others), securely handling sensitive data, and ensuring a seamless transaction flow while adhering to Payment Card Industr Data 
            Security Standard (PCI DSS) guidelines.
            Secure Transaction Processing: Payment data must be transmitted over secure channels using encryption (SSL/TLS). Additionally, sensitive data, such as credit card 
            numbers, should never be stored in plaintext.
            Error Handling & Feedback: Implement proper error handling, ensuring users get clear feedback in case of a failed transaction.
